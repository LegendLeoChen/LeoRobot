- Work:
1. Branch base: Basic tasks, complete voice command recognition + visual target detection + SLAM + navigation planning + simple grasping; (Node structure diagram below)

2. Branch master: Multi-tasking, on the basis of basic tasks, can perform sequential tasks - go to multiple locations in sequence to perform grasping of different targets, added angle calibration, increased scene waypoints. (Node structure diagram below)
